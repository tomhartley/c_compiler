- The majority of expressions
- If statements, else statements
- Return statements
- While loops (no break, no continue)
- For loops (no break, no continue)
- Single function only, but varying numbers of parameters (up to 4, at least)
- No function calls ;( <— was next on my todo list
- Amazing pretty printing of the AST (goes to stderr)
- Short circuit evaluation works! So && doesn’t evaluate its RHS if LHS is zero [same with ||]
- Fairly well architected code - no major hacks anywhere.
